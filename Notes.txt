- ts is a superset of js
Everything available in js is available in ts and many things are not available in ts

It allows you to write js code in more readable way
and also it allows you to write code in a more type safe way
and causes less bugs and errors

All the code in ts is compiled to js


Typescript is not about reinventing javascript
only use Typescript for type safety 

its all about type safety

type safety - 
we know that js allows us to do 2 + "2" = "22" it dosent stop you to calculate mismatched types 

ts allows you to stop this behavior 


What Typescript Does :
    static checking
    - it already present in java and c#
    - it is a compile time check
    Ts is just for static checking
    Analyze the code as we type. That's it 
    in ts we write more lines of code than js 


ts is for extension

tsx is similar to jsx but it is for typescript

how ts works 

ts = (compiled or transpiled) = js 

ts is a developement toll - your project still runs js 

it helps you to write better code with less errors and better to scale

js madhe code lihilya ver aplay la to code wrong ahe asa sangat nahi pn ts madhe lihile var te lihita lihita detect karta variable define nahi ahe asa
